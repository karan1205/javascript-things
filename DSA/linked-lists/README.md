# Linked List

## [Singly Linked List](singly-linked-list.js)
* A data structure that contains a head, tail and length property.
* Linked Lists consist of node, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null.

## [Doubly Linked List](doubly-linked-list.function.js)
* Almost identical to Singly Linked Lists except every node has another pointer, to the previous node!
