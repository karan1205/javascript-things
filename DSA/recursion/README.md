# Recursion

* A process (a function) that calls itself.

## The call stack
* It's a stack data structure.
* Any time a function is invoked it is placed (pushed) on the top of the call stack.
* When JavaScript sees the return keyword or when the function ends, the compiler will remove (pop)

## How recursive functions work
* Invoke the same function with a different input until you reach your base case!

## Base Case
* The condition when the recursion ends.

## Two essential parts of a recursive function!
* Base case
* Different Input
