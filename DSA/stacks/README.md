# Stacks

* A stack is an ordered list in which insertion and deletion are done at one end, called top.
* The last element inserted is the first one to be deleted.
* Hence, it is called the Last in First out (LIFO) or First in Last out(FILO) list.

* [Stack using Array](stack.array.js)
* [Stack using Linked List](stack.linked-list.js)
