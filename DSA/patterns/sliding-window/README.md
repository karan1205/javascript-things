# Sliding Window Pattern

* This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array ot number from one position to another.
* Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes(and a new window is created)
* Very careful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.

Examples -

* [Max Sum](max-sum.js)
