#Frequency Counter Pattern 

* The Frequency Counter pattern uses an object or set to collect values and the frequency of those values.

* This pattern is often used with an array or a string, and allows you to avoid nested loops (quadratic time complexity O(nÂ²)).

* The Frequency Counter pattern is most helpful when you have multiple pieces of data that you want to compare with one another.

Examples:

- [Same Squared](same-squared.js)
- [Anagrams](anagrams.js)
