# Queues

* A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.
* The order is First In First Out (FIFO).
* A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first.
* The difference between stacks and queues is in removing.
* In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.
